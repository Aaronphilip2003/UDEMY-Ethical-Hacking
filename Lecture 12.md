## Network Mapping

### Nmap/Zmap
- Huge Security Scanner
- From IP?IP range it can discover:
	- Open Ports
	- Running Services
	- Operating System
	- Connected Clients
*Read Nmap Books after the course*

**Zenmap is the GUI of nmap**

We'll be using zenmap
- type `zenmap` on terminal

- On zenmap we'll use a number of different profiles available.
	- Ping scan - A very simple scan which literally pings every ip posssible and if it gets a response it stores the information
	- Quick Scan ( Slower than ping scan ), but this will give us more information
	- Quick Scan Plus will give us even more information regarding the OS running on the devices and even the programs runnning on those devices.
